SAR Typing is a simple single-page typing speed test application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to practice typing with a preset text while visually tracking their progress. The application highlights incorrect characters in red, simulates a virtual keyboard with key animations, and provides real-time feedback.
